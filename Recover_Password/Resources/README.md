navigating in the application you can find the sign in page, in that you click frogot password
after that you will get a form which has nothing but a submit displayed
so by inspecting the page and searching inside that for, you will be able to find an input thats hidden with an email in it
by simply modifying the already entred email and hitting submit, you will get the flag

this is not a creazy breach but it still teaches us that we should not depend on element not visible to clients and assume that they will not be able to see and modifie it
because a user with lilttle knowlege and web development can still inspect the page and change the visibility of the element
