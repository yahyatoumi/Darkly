# File Upload Vulnerability Breach Report

## What I Found

This vulnerability is a file upload vulnerability in PHP, where the attacker can upload a file that has a script or code that can be executed later on the server.

## How I Found It

1. I was able to find this vulnerability by uploading a .jpg image file
2. I found out that it is the only format that's allowed to be uploaded on the website
3. By modifying the request and setting the name of the file to `anything.php`, I was able to get the flag

## Why This is Dangerous

By uploading a script or code in a file, the user can trigger it to run later on, which can result in the user accessing sensitive data, or even taking over the server.

## How to Prevent This

- The website should not only rely on the Content-Type header
- Change the filename to something generated by the application
- Set a file size limit
- Store the files on a different server. If that's not possible, store them outside of the webroot
- In the case of public access to the files, use a handler that gets mapped to filenames inside the application (someid -> file.ext)
- Run the file through an antivirus or a sandbox if available to validate that it doesn't contain malicious data
- Use MIME type validators
